Merck Group – Biotech sector

Company Overview:
The Merck Group (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a globally leading science and technology company with a particularly strong foothold in biotechnology. 
Over the past two decades, Merck has systematically transformed from a traditional pharmaceutical company into an integrated biotech player – 
driven by strategic acquisitions, technological innovation, and the consistent combination of drug development with advanced biotech infrastructure.

Two Pillars of Biotechnology at Merck:

-Healthcare Division (EMD Serono in North America):
Focused on biopharmaceuticals, particularly in oncology, immunology, and fertility medicine. 
Merck develops next-generation therapies here, including monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).

-Life Science Division (MilliporeSigma):
A global leader in lab reagents, production solutions, and CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing Organization) services. 
This division supports platforms for cell and gene therapy, mRNA production, and automated biomanufacturing systems.

Pipeline Details:

Merck has built a robust and expanding oncology pipeline centered on advanced targeted therapies. 
These drug candidates are at different stages of development (from early clinical trials to late-stage Phase III) 
and are based on novel mechanisms that precisely disrupt cancer cells — such as DNA repair inhibition, antibody-drug conjugates, and targeted apoptosis.

1. DNA Damage Response (DDR) Inhibitors
These compounds interfere with cancer cells' ability to repair DNA – especially effective in genetically unstable tumors.

-Tuvusertib (M1774)	
Inhibits DNA damage repair, leading to death of highly unstable cancer cells. 
Indications: lung, ovarian, and bladder cancers. Often combined with PARP inhibitors.

-M9466 (HRS‑1167)	
Selectively blocks PARP-1 – critical for DNA repair. Promising for BRCA-mutant tumors; tested in prostate and ovarian cancer combinations.

-Lartesertib (M4076)	
Targets tumors with specific mutations that respond to impaired DNA repair; combined with Tuvusertib.

-Peposertib		
Inhibits another key DNA repair enzyme. Being studied in early trials for DNA repair-deficient tumors.

2. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)
ADCs combine a targeted antibody with a potent cytotoxic payload, allowing the destruction of cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue.

-M9140	
Antibody targets CEACAM5 (common in colorectal cancer); coupled with exatecan via a tumor-cleavable linker. Indication: colorectal and other solid tumors.

-M3554	
Targets tumors like neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and sarcomas. Also uses exatecan. Phase I trials starting 2024.

-MK‑2870 / SKB264		
Targets TROP2-positive tumors (e.g. breast cancer); uses a belotecan-derived payload. Currently in Phase I/II.

3. Other Targeted Cancer Therapies
-Xevinapant		
Promotes programmed cell death in cancer cells. Phase III trial in head & neck cancer with radiochemotherapy.

-Berzosertib (M6620)	
Another DDR-targeting agent, originally licensed from Vertex. Effective in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (Phase II).

-Abituzumab		
Humanized antibody aimed at treating bone metastases in prostate cancer (Phase II).

Overview by Clinical Phase
Phase I	    M3554, M9140, Lartesertib, M9466
Phase I/II	MK‑2870, Tuvusertib
Phase II	  Berzosertib, Abituzumab
Phase III	  Xevinapant

Key Insights

-Strategic Expansion: With the acquisition of Serono (a biotech leader in oncology and reproductive medicine) and Sigma-Aldrich (a top global lab reagent supplier), 
Merck significantly expanded its biotech and life science footprint.

-Global Partnerships: Merck actively invests through M Ventures in biotech start-ups, collaborates with research institutes 
(e.g., KAIST in South Korea), and engages in AI-driven drug design partnerships (e.g., with Biolojic Design for multispecific antibody development).

-Forward Strategy: Merck aligns its R&D and innovation strategy with the future of precision medicine, genomics, digital biotechnology, 
and automated biofabrication – reinforcing its role as a core technology platform in the global biotech ecosystem.

Summary

-Merck combines advanced molecular targets (e.g. DNA repair enzymes, tumor antigens) with innovative therapeutic mechanisms 
(e.g. ADCs, kinase inhibitors, apoptosis inducers).

-The company is particularly strong in synthetic lethality approaches, meaning it disables critical repair pathways that selectively kill cancer cells.

-Many compounds are designed for combination therapies, including with immunotherapies and standard chemotherapies.

-The overall pipeline reflects a clear commitment to precision medicine, backed by a strong scientific foundation.
