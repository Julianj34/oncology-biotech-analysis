Company Profile: Systemic Structure of the Merck Group.

Merck is deeply specialized and systemically organized.
The clear separation into three specialized business sectors – Healthcare, Life Science, and Electronics – enables high-level expertise, targeted market access, and economies of scale across distinct industries.

At the same time, Merck fosters interdisciplinary emergence through deliberate cross-functional collaboration, shared innovation platforms, and common strategic focus areas. This creates synergies that strengthen the company’s long-term position.

Key areas where this becomes particularly evident include:

Genomics and precision medicine platforms,

The development of novel therapeutic modalities,

And the precise, automated control of complex manufacturing processes.

This structure positions Merck as an integrated innovation ecosystem, combining scientific depth with strategic connectivity.
