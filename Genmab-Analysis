Genmab A/S – Research Summary (2025)
1. Company Overview

Genmab A/S is a globally leading biotechnology company headquartered in Copenhagen, 
specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative antibody therapies, 
particularly for cancer and other serious diseases. Since its founding in 1999, 
Genmab has established itself through proprietary technology platforms such as DuoBody® and HexaBody®, 
as well as through strategic partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies. 
The company has a broad pipeline with more than 20 clinical and 20 preclinical development programs 
and is known for the development of successful drugs like Darzalex® (Daratumumab) and Kesimpta® (Ofatumumab). 
With a strong focus on R&D and a clear commitment to innovation, Genmab plays a significant role in creating new therapeutic options for patients worldwide.

2. Antibody Development & Mechanisms of Action

Genmab develops specialized antibodies for cancer treatment, 
primarily based on a platform that uses genetically engineered mice to produce fully human antibodies. 
These human antibodies reduce immune reactions and improve patient tolerability. Additionally, the UniBody® technology enables shortened, 
stable antibody formats that minimize immune system activation.

The antibodies work as follows:

    Daratumumab (Darzalex®) targets myeloma (blood cancer) cells by activating multiple immune mechanisms to destroy them.

    Epcoritamab (Epkinly®) is a bispecific antibody that directly links T cells to cancer cells, triggering a targeted immune response.

    Tisotumab Vedotin (Tivdak®) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that delivers a cytotoxic payload into cancer cells to selectively kill them.

3. Oncology Focus & Pipeline

Genmab focuses on innovative antibody therapies for both hematologic cancers and solid tumors. Beyond Daratumumab, 
the company is advancing other important treatments:

    Ofatumumab (Kesimpta®): Initially developed for leukemia, now successfully used for multiple sclerosis.

    Teprotumumab (Tepezza®): A non-oncology antibody used for thyroid eye disease.

Promising pipeline candidates include:

    Epcoritamab: Approved since 2023 as the first subcutaneous therapy for certain lymphomas. Currently under investigation for frontline therapy use.

    Acasunlimab: Bispecific antibody activating T cells against lung cancer (Phase II).

    Tecaginlimab: Enhances immune activation against tumors (Phase II).

    HexaBody-CD38: Enhanced antibody for blood cancers, currently in Phase II.

4. Genmab’s Antibody Technology Platforms

Genmab’s proprietary technologies significantly enhance antibody efficacy:

    DuoBody®:
    Creates bispecific antibodies that bind two different targets simultaneously. It combines two antibody binding sites into one molecule—e.g., 
    Epcoritamab, which directly links immune cells to tumor cells.

    HexaBody®:
    Enhances natural immune activity by creating hexameric antibody clusters that amplify immune responses and improve cancer cell destruction.

    Combination Platforms (DuoHexaBody®, HexElect®):
    Merge DuoBody and HexaBody into highly potent antibodies that bind two targets and form immune-activating hexamers. 
    HexElect activates only when both targets are recognized, reducing off-target effects.

These platforms enable Genmab to deliver next-generation antibody therapies that are being widely studied and adopted in clinical research.

5. Strategic Partnerships

Genmab has built strategic collaborations with over 20 top-tier pharma and biotech firms, enabling fast and effective global commercialization:

    Janssen (Johnson & Johnson):
    License partner for Darzalex®, a multi-billion-dollar myeloma drug, with royalty payments to Genmab.

    AbbVie:
    Co-development and commercialization of Epcoritamab and other bispecific antibodies. 
    The collaboration includes large upfront payments and milestone agreements.

    Seagen:
    Co-development of Tisotumab Vedotin (Tivdak®) for advanced cervical cancer. Development costs and profits are split 50/50.

    BioNTech:
    Joint R&D on immunotherapies such as Acasunlimab and Tecaginlimab, leveraging Genmab’s antibody tech with BioNTech’s cancer immunology expertise.

    Additional Partnerships (e.g., Novartis, Roche):
    Licensing and development agreements for antibody products, including strategic acquisitions like ProfoundBio, to expand the innovation pipeline.

Through these alliances, Genmab leverages external strengths while staying lean and focused—making it a leader in antibody-based therapeutics.

6. Financial Overview

    Current share price (NASDAQ): ~$20.55 (as of June 25, 2025)

7. Valuation Metrics (as of 2025)

    Trailing P/E (TTM): ~11–12× — well below historic highs of up to 75× (2021), near 10-year lows

    Forward P/E: ~11–12×

    PEG Ratio: ~1.1–1.2 — suggests balanced valuation relative to growth expectations

    Fair value estimate: Based on a fair P/E of ~22.5× and EPS of ~$1.68 →
    Fair price ≈ $37.80, implying significant upside if growth targets are met

8. Outlook & Oncology Growth Factor

    Global oncology market expected to exceed $500 billion by 2030

    Genmab stands to benefit from Epcoritamab and its advanced pipeline

    Huge market opportunities in cell & antibody therapies, worth billions per indication

Conclusion

Genmab is a research-driven biotech company with high innovative strength, clinical maturity, and strategically relevant partnerships.
The financial base is strong, the pipeline is advanced, and collaborations with AbbVie, Pfizer, and BioNTech significantly increase success probabilities.
It is a systemically relevant player that actively shapes the antibody development of many other firms.
This positions Genmab as one of the few "infrastructure builders" in the biotech sector – 
comparable to NVIDIA in AI, but in the field of antibody therapeutics.
